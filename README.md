# NumericalODE
Source for IVPs: David F. Griffiths Â· Desmond J. Higham Numerical Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations
Source for BVPS: Taken from various sources. The source for two of the BVPs are added. Other examples are either taken from an internet source or written by me. 

Numerical solutions for ODEs are written by me without considering their theoretical convergence using C++ and a visualization tool.
